## Propagating Compation Bands in Porous Media

> ### All classes

> ![prl](/images/bands_classes.gif)    
> Typical compaction patterns emanating from a uniaxially loaded confined two-dimensional structured porous media, here with a solid area fraction of ϕ = 0.40 and the following parameters:    
> (a) $S = 4 \cdot 10^{−3}, R = 10^{−5}$    
> (b) $S = 4 \cdot 10^{−3}, R = 4 \cdot 10^{−4}$    
> (c) $S = 4 \cdot 10^{−2}, R = 2 \cdot 10^{−2}$    
> (d) $S = 1.32 \cdot 10^{−3}, R = 4 \cdot 10^{−3}$    
> (e) $S = 10^{−1}, R = 10^{−5}$      
> (f) $S = 4 \cdot 10^{−3}, R = 10^{−1}$   
> The structure is colored according to the plastic Hencky strain rate.
