> ### All classes
> Typical compaction patterns emanating from a uniaxially loaded confined two-dimensional structured porous media, here with a solid area fraction of $\phi = 0.40$:     
> ![prl](/images/bands_classes.gif)     
> The structures are colored according to the plastic Hencky strain rate. 
> The following parameters are used to get the various patterns:        
> (a) $S = 4 \cdot 10^{−3}, R = 10^{−5}$    
> (b) $S = 4 \cdot 10^{−3}, R = 4 \cdot 10^{−4}$    
> (c) $S = 4 \cdot 10^{−2}, R = 2 \cdot 10^{−2}$    
> (d) $S = 1.32 \cdot 10^{−3}, R = 4 \cdot 10^{−3}$    
> (e) $S = 10^{−1}, R = 10^{−5}$      
> (f) $S = 4 \cdot 10^{−3}, R = 10^{−1}$

> ### Three-dimensional open-cell structure
> While the above video shows two-dimensional structures, the same can be obtained with three-dimensional structures.
> Below is an example of an open-cell structure.

> Here, $S = 10^{−2}, R = 10^{−3}$
