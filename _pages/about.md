I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Alpine Mass Movements](https://alpinemassmovements.ethz.ch/) group of [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en/) and the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research ([SLF](https://www.slf.ch/en/)) in Davos. 
In 2023, I defended my [PhD in Mechanics](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edme-mechanics/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), supervised by [Prof. J. Gaume](https://igt.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.MzA5Njcx.TGlzdC8xMTYxLC0yMTE1ODgxMzY3.html) and [Prof. J.-F. Molinari](https://people.epfl.ch/jean-francois.molinari). 
My research focuses on computational modeling of the mechanics of porous solids and granular flows, with a particular emphasis on snow. 
I'm currently working with the Material Point Method (MPM), however, I am interested in the development and application of all kinds of numerical methods in solid and fluid mechanics.

Previously, I have worked for [DNV Oil&Gas](https://www.dnv.com/), [EVRY Consulting](https://www.tietoevry.com/) and interned at [FFI](https://www.ffi.no/en) and  [Equinor](https://www.equinor.com/).
I received a [Master of Science in Computational Science and Engineering](https://rw.ethz.ch/) from ETH Zürich in 2018, with the thesis entitled _Computing Measure-Valued Solutions of the Leray-Alpha Model of Turbulence_ supervised by [Prof. S. Mishra](https://camlab.ethz.ch/the-group/group-head.html) at the [Seminar for Applied Mathematics](https://math.ethz.ch/sam).

Code
======
I am soon releasing an efficient and low-dependency Material Point Method code written in C++ for modeling elasto-viscoplastic materials.
It is parallelized with OpenMP and easily adaptable to many problems. Many constitutive models are directly avalaible, formulated in a finite strain framework.
The code is called _Ma++er_ (pronounced _Matter_).   
Please contact me if you are interested!
